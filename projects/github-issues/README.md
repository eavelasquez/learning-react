# GitHub Issues

## Description

This is a simple app that fetches github issues using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues). Internally, it uses the [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) library to manage the state of the API calls.

## Deployment
