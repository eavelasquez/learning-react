# React Hooks

## Description

This is a project to experiment with React Hooks. The app is using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch data and play with the different hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`, `useReducer` and `useCallback`.

## Development

Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies. Then run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.

## Testing

Run `pnpm test` to run the tests.

## Deployment

Run `pnpm build` to build the app for production. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
